## Humble Origins

Linked lists are great, but we can do better! Let's try **rearranging the pointers** in an interesting way.

Instead of starting at one end of the list, let's set our first pointer at the **middle** of the list!

Now, let's make new pointers going to the **center** of each **sublist** on the left and right of the center.

Let's do it again!

Would ya look at that, we've got a **tree**! ðŸŒ²

## Types of Trees

Right now, we can determine some properties that all trees have.

* All trees have a **root node**.
* All nodes can point to **child nodes.** Or, if they don't have any children, they are **leaves.**

We can add more and more constraints to our tree to make them more useful!

First, let's add the constraint that **node can only have 2 or fewer children** to create a **binary tree.**

Then, let's **ensure our tree is sorted** to create a **binary search tree.** A tree is sorted if it has these properties:

* Every value in the **left subtree** of a node is **less than** the node's value.
* Every value in the **right subtree** of a node is **greater than** the node's value.
* Values are **transitive** - there are **no duplicate values**.
* The tree is **complete** - it is possible to **compare any two values** in the tree and say that one is **either less than or greater than the other.**
* The tree is **antisymmetric** - If `p < q` is true and `q < r` is also true, then it must follow that `p < r`.

## Tree Operations

There are **three important operations** that trees should support: **find, insert, and delete.**

### **Find**

Finding a value in a tree uses Binary Search. Click the link below to read up on it!

### Insert

The insert algorithm is **very similar to binary search.** Here are the steps to take:

* Search for the item. **If it's found, then do nothing** since the value is already in the tree.
* If it's not found (search would return null in this case), then create a node and put it where it should be found. If using recursion, this last step is already done- all we need to do is return a new node!

Here's the algorithm:

```java
public BST insert(BST T, Key sk) {
    if (T == null) {
        // Create new leaf with given key. Different from search
        return new BST(sk, null, null); 
    }
    if (sk.equals(T.key)) {
        return T;
    } else if (sk < T.key) {
        T.left = find(T.left, sk); // Different from search
    } else {
        T.right = find(T.right, sk); // Different from search
    }
}
```

### Delete

This one's a bit trickier because we need to make sure that the new tree still **preserves the binary search tree structure.** That means that we might have to shuffle around nodes after the deletion. There are **three cases:**

A) The node to delete is a **leaf**. This is an easy case- just remove that node and you're done!

B) The node to delete has **one child.** In this case, **swap** the node with its child, then **delete the node.**

![Deleting a node with one child.](<../../img/assets/image (65).png>)

C) The node to delete has **two children.** This one's trickier, because we still need to preserve the tree structure! In this case, we have to **traverse the node's children** to find the **next biggest value** and swap that up to replace the old node.

## Asymptotic Analysis

A binary tree can be **bushy** or **spindly.** These two cases have dramatically different performances!

**Bushy** trees are the **best case.** A tree is bushy if **every parent has exactly 2 children.**

A bushy tree is guaranteed to have a height of $\Theta(\log(n))$ which means that the runtimes for adding and searching will also be $\Theta(\log(n))$ .

**Spindly** trees are the **worst case.** A tree is spindly if **every parent has exactly 1 child.** This makes the tree essentially just a linked list!

A spindly tree has a height of  $\Theta(n)$ which means that the runtimes for adding and searching will also be $\Theta(n)$ .

In [Balanced BSTs](balanced-search-structures.md), we will explore ways of guaranteeing that a tree is bushy!

## Limits of Trees

While trees are extremely versatile and fantastic for a variety of applications, trees have some limitations that make it difficult to use in some situations.

* **All items in a tree need to be comparable.** We can't construct a binary tree out of categorical data, like models of cars, for example.
* **The data must be hierarchical.** If data can be traversed through in multiple ways, or forms loops, [Graphs](../graphs.md) are probably better.
* **The best case runtime is** $\Theta(\log(n))$ . This might seem good, but other data structures like [Tries](tries.md) and [Hash Tables](../hashing.md) can be as good as **** $\Theta(1)$ !
