## Main Ideas

A **trie** is a specific implementation of a set and is short for **retrieval tree.**

It only works on sets with a **finite alphabet**, like digits or ASCII characters, for example. The idea is that each node can act like an **array containing all characters in the alphabet** and we can just access the branches super fast by indexing into them!

Tries are fantastic for searching to see if a word is contained in a set. Here's an example:

![This trie contains the words 'batcat', 'batman', and 'banana'.](<../../img/assets/image (74).png>)

This is great because it makes the `add()` and `contains()` functions run in $\Theta(1)$ time! Additionally, it makes special string operations like prefix matching or autocomplete very efficient.

We can improve this data structure a lot- for instance, we can condense the leaves to reduce the number of nodes like this:

![](<../../img/assets/image (75).png>)

I won't go into too much detail on how to optimize it further, or how to implement the actual functions efficiently, but hopefully you'll have a good sense of how to do it yourself after learning about concepts like [Hashing and Hash Tables](../hashing.md) or [Sets](../collections/sets.md) etc.
