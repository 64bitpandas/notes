# Amortization

**Amortization** means **spreading out.**

Sometimes, an operation takes different amounts of time for different values of $n$. Rather than having to report runtimes for each different case, we can instead average all of them out and report the **amortized runtime.**

This is especially good for functions where most actions have a low cost, but a few have a high cost. We'll see an example of this further down the page!

## A Case Study: Resizing Arrays

As you probably know, normal Java arrays don't resize. If we create a `new int[5]` then that array will always have a length of 5.

But what if we wanted to make an array resize itself every time it reaches capacity? (Like a `List`!) Let's see what happens when we **add one to the array size:**

First, we have to make a new array with a new size:

![](<../img/assets/image (16).png>)

Then, we have to copy over all of the old elements over:

![](<../img/assets/image (17).png>)

Finally, we can add in the new element!

![](<../img/assets/image (19).png>)

**Let's analyze the runtime of this operation.**

* A single resizing will take $\Theta(n)$ time**.**
* Adding a single element will take $\Theta(1)$ time**.**
* Together, a single operation will take $\Theta(n+1)$ time, which simplifies into  $\Theta(n)$ .
* Since we're doing a n-operation n times, **the end result is a resizing function that is**$\Theta(n^2)$. **We can do better with the power of amortization!**

### **What if we doubled the size instead of adding one?**

* A single resizing will take $\Theta(2n)$ time \_\*\*\_which simplifies into $\Theta(n)$ time.
  * We do this every time the array hits a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ...).
* Adding a single element will take $\Theta(1)$ time.
  * We do this every time we add a new element, so in all we add n elements. Therefore, this is an
    * $\Theta(n)$operation.

**Therefore, the unsimplified function is:** $\Theta(n + (2 + 4 + 8 ... +2^i))$ where $2^i$ is the largest power of two less than n. This might not seem clear on its own, so let's rewrite it:

$
\theta(n + (\frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + ... + 8 + 4 + 2))
$

Intuitively, this looks like this:

![](<../img/assets/image (39).png>)

Mathematically, it looks like this:

$
n + n\sum_{n=1}^{n}(\frac{1}{2})^n
$

Which simplifies to $2n$if you recall your power series properties . **Therefore, this approach is** $\Theta(n)$ **!!**
