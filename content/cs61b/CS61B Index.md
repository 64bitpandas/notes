# Welcome

## Welcome to 64bitpanda's CS61B Guide!

(If you are looking at this in github, go to [cs61b.bencuan.me](https://cs61b.bencuan.me) for a much better experience!)

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to data structures written with an intention to supplement learning and reviewing of Berkeley's [CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs61b) material. Main topics include:

* Object oriented programming basics
* Abstract data types
* Asymptotics and runtime analysis
* Sorting algorithms
* Search algorithms
* And some more miscellaneous topics thrown in!

This guide is written to be as easy to follow and digestible as possibleüòÄI've included lots of diagrams, practice problems, and more intuitive explanations instead of the more straightforward approach most textbooks use. **This isn't a replacement for lectures and other course content.** You probably need to look at those first, and come here if something isn't sticking!

## Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everythingüòÅBut you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for 61B exams, touching up on data structures knowledge, or whatever you want!

**Basic knowledge gained from** [**CS61A**](https://cs61a.org/) **or equivalent is assumed.** [Click here](https://cs61a.bencuan.me) for my notes for that!

## How to use this guide

Again, I will emphasize that this **isn't a textbook.** While I try to be as comprehensive as possible, I'm sure I missed plenty of important concepts or assume you know others. I don't have an army of peer reviewers and guinea pigs to test-read the thing, so it's also not guaranteed that everything is 100% accurate. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs61b-notes/issues) if you think something's wrong!

{% hint style="warning" %}
For more difficult topics, I'll put a warning like this at the top of the page with links to prerequisites or supporting topics so that you won't feel completely lost üòâ
{% endhint %}

There are also plenty of practice problems to try out! Here's an non-exhaustive list of pages with those if you are mostly interested in them and not the conceptual content.

* [Access Control](oop/access-control.md#practice)
* [Dynamic Method Selection](oop/dynamic-method-selection.md)
* [Generic Types](oop/generics.md#generic-subtypes)
* [Asymptotics Practice](asymptotics/asymptotics-practice.md)



## How to contribute

Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs61b-notes) and create a pull request. All contributions are welcome! Pages are formatted in [Markdown syntax](https://docsimg.com/editing-content/markdown). Please **edit existing pages only** unless you have [created an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs61b-notes/issues) and I have gotten back to you about making a new page. Thanks üòÑ

The pages that could be most improved (in no particular order) are [Union Find (Disjoint Sets)](abstract-data-types/union-find-disjoint-sets.md), [Stacks and Queues](abstract-data-types/collections/stacks-and-queues.md), [Linked Lists](abstract-data-types/collections/linked-lists.md), [Sets](abstract-data-types/collections/sets.md), [Sorting](sorting/sorting-basics.md), [Searching](algorithms/searching/), [Binary Search](algorithms/searching/binary-search.md), [Shortest Paths](algorithms/shortest-paths/), and [Exceptions](misc-topics/exceptions.md). Feel free to add whatever content you like (explanations, examples, practice problems, memes...) to these!

Additionally, there are plenty of topics (Regex, Testing, Files/Scanners, Ranges, GUI just to name a few) that aren't currently covered in this guide. If you want to add one of these topics, please create an issue first but it will almost certainly be approved.
