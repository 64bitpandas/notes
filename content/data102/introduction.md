## Main Ideas

**1. Making Decisions Under Uncertainty**

**2. Modeling in the Real World**
 - Assumptions and Robustnessr


## Problem Solving

Typically, we observe data $x$ and $y$, and want to understand some hidden state in the world $\theta$.


### Assumptions
**Frequentist:** $y$ is random, $\theta$ is fixed
**Bayesian:** $y$ is random, $\theta$ is fixed

**Parametric:** Make assumptions about the relationship between $\theta$ and $y$, then use these assumptions to find the best value of $\theta$ given $y$
**Nonparametric:** Don't make any assumptions, and find any good function $f$ such that $\theta = f(y)$
