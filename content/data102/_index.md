## Data102 Notes

Here are my notes for the Fall 2022 offering of [Data 102](https://data102.org/), Berkeley's Inference for Data Science course.

Data 102 explores two major concepts: **making decisions under uncertainty** and **modeling the real world**. This is all about making assumptions-- here are some definitions:
 - **Frequentist:** $y$ (data) is random, $\theta$ (parameter) is fixed
 - **Bayesian:** $y$ is random, $\theta$ is random
 - **Parametric:** Make assumptions about the relationship between $\theta$ and $y$, then use these assumptions to find the best value of $\theta$ given $y$
 - **Nonparametric:** Don't make any assumptions, and find any good function $f$ such that $\theta = f(y)$

For the most part, these notes should be pretty complete in terms of content, but could use some cleaning up (as well as more examples).
