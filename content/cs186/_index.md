# Welcome to my CS186 Guide!

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to databases written with an intention to supplement learning and reviewing of Berkeley's [CS186](https://cs186berkeley.net) material. Main topics include:

* [SQL syntax](<cs186/00 SQL Basics>)
* [How to improve popular sorting and hashing algorithms to work well with limited memory](<cs186/04 Sorting and Hashing>)
* [B+ trees](<cs186/03 B+ Trees>) and other advanced indexing structures
* [Join algorithms](<cs186/05 Iterators and Joins>)
* [Query optimization](<cs186/07 Query Optimization>)
* [Parallel query processing](<cs186/09 Parallel Query Processing>)
* [Crash Recovery (AERIES)](<cs186/10 Recovery>)
* [Database transactions and Concurrency](<cs186/08 Transactions>)
* [Entity-Relationship Diagrams](<cs186/12 ER Diagrams>)

I recognize that the course notes for 186 can be *very* dense sometimes, and don't cover 100% of the information you need to do well on projects and exams. While this also doesn't covery everything, I try to focus on content that the notes don't.

**This isn't a replacement for lectures and other course content.** You probably need to look at those first, and come here if something isn't sticking!

## Disclaimer

Although I am a 186 TA, these notes are not official course content. They have not been reviewed or approved by an instructor, and there may be inaccurate or missing information. Please don't bother the other course staff with questions about the content here- contact me instead (email or office hours).


## How to contribute

See the [contributing guide](/contributing) for more details!

One particular addition that needs to be made is an entry on Functional Dependencies. I don't have notes written for this since it was not covered when I took the course.
