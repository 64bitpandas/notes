## Welcome to my CS70 Guide!

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to discrete math and probability, specifically for computer science applications. It's based off of Berkeley's [CS70](https://www.eecs70.org/) material from Fall 2020 (and doubles as my notes for the course).

### Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everything😁But you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for exams, touching up on discrete math, or whatever you want!

### How to use this guide

Again, I will emphasize that this **isn't a textbook.** While I try to be as comprehensive as possible, I'm sure I missed plenty of important concepts or assume you know others. I don't have an army of peer reviewers and guinea pigs to test-read the thing, so it's also not guaranteed that everything is 100% accurate. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs70-notes/issues) if you think something's wrong!

This content was ported from my original [CS70 Notes](https://cs70.bencuan.me), so you may see some strange formatting here and there. Again, please create an issue if you spot anything overly egregious.

### Probability Notice

Although the discrete math notes are mostly complete, the probability notes are not (and likely will never be). If you like my style of notes, you should refer to the [Data 140 Textbook](https://prob140.org/textbook/content/README.html) for this half of the course.

## How to contribute

See the [contributing guide](/contributing) for more details!

For LaTeX specifically, you can easily create expressions by surrounding them with double dollar signs. For example, `$\lnot A \iff B$` will create the equation $\lnot A \iff B$ when rendered. Check out the [LaTeX Reference](/cs70/latex-reference.md) for commonly used commands.
