# Welcome

### Welcome to 64bitpanda's CS70 Guide!

(If you are looking at this in GitHub, go to [cs70.bencuan.me](https://cs70.bencuan.me) for a much better experience!)

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to discrete math and probability, specifically for computer science applications. It's based off of Berkeley's [CS70](https://www.eecs70.org/) material (and doubles as my notes for the course).

### Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everythingüòÅBut you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for exams, touching up on discrete math, or whatever you want!\*

\*Must comply with [GPL license](LICENSE) (yay open source!)

### How to use this guide

Again, I will emphasize that this **isn't a textbook.** While I try to be as comprehensive as possible, I'm sure I missed plenty of important concepts or assume you know others. I don't have an army of peer reviewers and guinea pigs to test-read the thing, so it's also not guaranteed that everything is 100% accurate. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs70-notes/issues) if you think something's wrong!

{% hint style="warning" %}
For more difficult topics, I'll put a warning like this at the top of the page with links to prerequisites or supporting topics so that you won't feel completely lost :fearful:
{% endhint %}

### How to contribute

Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs70-notes) and create a pull request. All contributions are welcome! Pages are formatted in [Markdown syntax](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown). Please **edit existing pages only** unless you have [created an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs61b-notes/issues) and I have gotten back to you about making a new page. Thanks üòÑ

This content is hosted on [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), and relies fairly heavily on their custom formatting for LaTeX parsing, tables, and more! You can take a look at their documentation for using these features [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).

For LaTeX specifically, you can easily create expressions by surrounding them with double dollar signs. For example, `$\lnot A \iff B$` will create the equation $\lnot A \iff B$when rendered. Check out the [LaTeX Reference](latex-reference.md) for commonly used commands.
